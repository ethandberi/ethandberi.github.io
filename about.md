Hi! I'm Ethan. I'm:
- ...interested in [existential risks](https://80000hours.org/articles/existential-risks/) - well, reducing them, that is.
- ...an incoming undergrad at Oxford, studying Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.
- ...and a generally curious person, so I'll probably write about a whole bunch of things on here. <br>

Email me at ethandberi01 (at) gmail (dot) com if you're interested in anything I've written/done, or just want to say hi :)
